# E-commerce Back End

This repo contains all the code needed for the back end of an E-Commerce site!  We have set up our server, created Sequelize Models to handle the column information inside the data base, and created all GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes needed to manipulate that data!  Relationships have also been made between models to easily link the data between each other.
